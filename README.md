## Introduction

This work verifies the compromise between the (total) reconstruction error and the fairnes measure in a dimensional reduction problem
Fairness measure is given by the difference between the reconstruction errors of the two considered classes. 
We use a multi-objective approach (SPEA2 algorithm) and select a single non-dominated solution based on
the minimum weighted sum (with equal importance, but taking the scales of each objective into account).
We consider the Default Credit dataset - see: [Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009). The comparisons of data mining
techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. Expert Systems with
Applications, 36(2), p. 2473-2480] - and some functions were based on [Samadi et al. (2018). The price of fair pca:
One extra dimension. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, p. 10976-10987].
